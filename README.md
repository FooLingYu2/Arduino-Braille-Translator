# Arduino-Braille-Translator
Arduino code for a system that translates Braille into normal letters and punctuation with the use of push buttons, LEDs, and an LCD screen

I created this device for my Microprocessors class project. It uses push buttons to turn on corresponding LEDs that match combinations of the 6 dots used in Braille. Other push buttons are used to translate, reset, and clear the LCD screen. Feel free to use the code to help in your own projects. Enjoy!
